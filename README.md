# Project Brimstone

Project Brimstone is a single-player 2D roguelike. Players assume the role of an
alchemist fighting their way through the levels of hell. Through crafting players
can create weapons, potions, and other useful items to aid them in fighting off
the hordes of enemies they will encounter on their quest through the procedurally
generated inferno. A full description can be found [here](https://github.com/SCCapstone/RogueGames/wiki/Project-Description).
